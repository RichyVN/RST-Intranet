== Installation ==

Thank you for downloading our Simple Intranet Directory plugin.  Here is a quick primer on the installation and setup for installing our plugin-in.  

1. Download and unzip the plugin and copy/extract the "simple-intranet-directory" folder and all of its child files to the "wp-content/plugins" directory of your WordPress.org installation.  

2. You will then need to activate the Simple Intranet Directory plugin in the "Plugins" area of the Dashboard. 

3. Set up your employee directory by uploading employee photos via the "Users/Your Profile" menus.

4. Add a searchable employee directory listing by inserting the [employees] shortcode into a post or page. 

5. Optionally include the following parameters within the [employees] shortcode;
- include a search box with email, title or department pulldown menu options and filter out specific roles/groups e.g. [employees search="yes" email="yes" title="yes" department="yes" search_exclude="administrator"]
- set pixel width of avatar/employee photos e.g. [employees avatar="100"]
- include only specific groups/roles, sort by last_name (or first_name) in ascending or descending (ASC/DESC) order and limit to 10 people per page (25 is default) e.g. [employees group="subscriber" sort="last_name" order="ASC" limit="10"].
- include only specific users in a commas separated list [employees username="dsmith,rcharles"] 

6. View these and more options at the "Simple Intranet" menu item in your Dashboard or visit http://www.simpleintranet.org.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add the directory? =

Simply add the [employees] shortcode into any post or page.  Then update users profile information if you are an admin, or have your users update their own profiles under "Users / Your Profile" when they login. Limit to 25 employees per page using the limit parameter, display the search bar above the listing, exclude for example "board" and "executive" custom groups from search pull-down, set avatar pixel width to 100, display only Subscriber roles and sort by last name in ascending order as follows: [employees limit="25" search="yes" search_exclude="board,executive" avatar="100" group="subscriber" sort="last_name" order="ASC"].

= How can I change the look of my employee directory? =

You can edit the style sheet file called "si_employees.css" found in the /css folder.  This includes classes for the "employeephoto" and "employeebio" and "outofoffice" areas of the employee directory.

= Where do I add custom fields? =

In the "Users / Your Employee Profile" under the Country field you can add up to 3 custom fields.  Admins can edit the labels and all other roles can add content next to these labels.

= How does the Out of Office alert function work? =
In "Users / Your Profile" at the top of the page you will see "Out of office notification is OFF. | Turn ON.".  Click "Turn ON" to activate a message above your employee listing in the Employee Directory.   Go down to the bottom of your profile page, and edit the "Out of office text" field. Enter custom out of office notification text here, and it will show above your user photo in the Employee Directory, assuming you have activated the out of office alert at the top of the page.

= Can Admins change the out of office status for other users? =
Yes, they can edit any users profile information and just update the pull-down menu "Update out of office status" further down a user's profile page.  Just remember that when logged in as an Admin or other user, if you click to "Turn On or Off" the out of office alert at the top of the user profile page, that will only affect the logged in user out of office status (and not the user which you are editing).

= How do I set up more detailed employee profiles in the Employee Directory? =
We have added the ability to enable a custom editable biography page when you click-through from the main listing of the Employee Directory.  This will allow employees to upload files, add photos and customize the layout and formatting of their own profile page.  The first time the employee directory is activated (by adding the [employees] shortcode to any page or post), the detailed biography page will be prepopulated with all available information from the Users / Your Profile section of the Dashboard.  Once this page is accessed for the first time, it can then be edited and overwritten with custom content.

= Where do I find options to set the Employee Directory detailed pages? =
Login as an Administrator and "Visit Users / Your Profile" and scroll down to Company Information to view these selectable options:
* Check if you want to include a clickable profile page accessible by clicking on the photo or name in the Employee Directory.
Note, each person will have a post generated with their name as the title, and saved in the Employees category.
* Check to allow each user to create and edit a custom HTML detail/biography page. 
* Check to hide all e-mails from the Employee Directory.
